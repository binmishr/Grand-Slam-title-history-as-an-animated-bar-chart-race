Introduction
==============

I’ve spoiled it by putting the gif at the start of the post but if you are interested in how it was made then read on!

I’ve seen this kind of charts around the web so I wanted to make a tennis-related one and what better than using Grand Slam wins since the very beginning; 1877.

The main package that is needed for the animation is gganimate. As the name suggests it integrates with ggplot to make an animation given many different charts and a transition variable.
